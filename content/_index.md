# Hello!

I am Taufiq, a Year 2 Computer Science student studying at [National University of Singapore (NUS)](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/).

I don't really have any specific interests at the moment but the projects that I've been working on lately
tend to involve finding loopholes and exploiting them to benefit the people around me (and perhaps myself).

Places I've interned at:

- [**Open Government Products, Singapore**](https://www.open.gov.sg/) – Built COVID products for the nation and messing around with Git Trees for a CMS
- [**A\*STAR**](https://www.a-star.edu.sg/ihpc) – Built a monitoring platform for pipe leakages
- [**Codigo**](https://www.google.com/search?q=codigo&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8) – Wrote the app for delivering for WhiteCoat, a leading telehealth provider in Singapore
