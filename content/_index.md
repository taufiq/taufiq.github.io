# Hello!

I am Taufiq, a Year 2 Computer Science student studying at [National University of Singapore (NUS)](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/).

I don't really have any specific interests at the moment but the projects that I've been working on lately
tend to involve finding loopholes and exploiting them to benefit the people around me (and perhaps myself).
