            <i class="fa fa-plane"></i> What's next?</h2>
        <p class="p-white">After acquiring a diploma in ISF, I would like to further my studies and attain a degree in either Information Security
            (IS) or attain a more general degree such as
            <b>computer science</b>. I love the pursuit of knowledge, especially when it comes to IT. By furthering my studies,
            I will be able to acquire more knowledge and deepen my understanding of computer science, which I very much adore.
            The university that I intend to go is NUS. But if it is possible, I would like to attend the holy grails of universities
            which offer computer science. Those universities are
            <b>Massachusetts Institute of Technology, National University of Singapore (NUS), Harvard, and Stanford University</b>.
            After this, I would very much like to work in new startups as they offer unique working cultures.</p>
